this is my first diary

goal summary:
	level0: only simple & obvious statements. =, $, #
	level1: only simple & obvious statements, no nesting of "for" loops. ?, *, [] only for file matching
	level2: only simple & obvious statements, no nesting of "for/while/if" statements. single quote
	level3: "for/while/if" statements can be nested. double quotes, unquote
	level4: simple use of mv/chmod/ls/rm. <>, &&, ||, ;, \, ), $(), $(()). $() is equivalent to back quotes. $(()) for arithmetic

The only Shell builtins that I need to translate directly into Python are:
	exit
	read
	cd
	test (-r, -d)
	expr
	echo (-n) (They all must be translated into Python ways. E.g., translate "echo xxx" into "print (xxx)")



demo0 (level 0)
	handle "echo" without quotes
	handle "ls", and with option "-l"
	handle "pwd"
	handle "date"
	other basic commands
	handle multiple demo0 commands

demo1:
	handle "cd"
	handle "for" loop, and with "exit"
	handle files
	handle read strings

demo2:
	handle arguments
	handle "if" and "elif"
	handle single quotes

demo3:
	handle double quotes
	handle "test"
	handle "ls", with multiple options
	handle "while" loop

demo4:
	handle checking directory
	handle multiple sequences in "while" loop
	handle all demos

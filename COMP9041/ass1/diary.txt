12/09	13:00	18:00	finished level 0	level 0 is quite easy
13/09	13:00	13:30	updated level 0		updated in some small details
13/09	13:00	17:00	finished level 1	level 1 is easy too, not much things need to be handled
14/09	10:00	18:00	did level 2		level 2 needs some more conditions
15/09	13:00	17:00	finished level 2	
15/09	14:00	17:00	finished level 3	level 3 is based on level 2, finished it very quickly
15/09	17:00	19:00	did level 4		level 4 needs some special consitions
16/09	10:00	19:00	updated level 4		worked on nested loop
20/09	15:00	22:00	updated level 4		nested loop/if condition is finished, updating structure, handle more conditions
21/09	14:00	19:00	updated level 4		bug fix
23/09	13:00	17:00	updated level 4		add more conditions (like chmod)
26/09	13:00	17:00	updated structure	add more conditions, modifier loop/if structure to make them more robust
27/09	12:00	18:00	updated in echo		made echo can handle many special conditions

note: my code still cannot solve type conversion, that is, for example, a variable is "string", when it comes to IF condition, it will be converted to type "int", but in the following ELSE condition, it should be still treated as type "string", but my code will handle the variable as "int" in ELSE
